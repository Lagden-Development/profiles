# Hi there, I'm Zach. ðŸ‘‹

An enthusiastic full-stack developer based in Ascot, UK. In addition to my role as a developer, I also serve as a head coach at [Jam Coding](https://jamcoding.co.uk/) where I help to provide better coding education for the younger generation; and alongside this, I teach [skills bootcamps](https://step8up.co.uk/step8up-skills-bootcamps) at [Step8Up](https://step8up.co.uk).

You will find most of my open-source projects within [Lagden Development](https://github.com/Lagden-Development); and my professional work at [Step8Up](https://github.com/step8up-uk) and [CLCS](https://github.com/CL-Client-Solutions).

**ðŸ”­ Currently working on:** Inspiring young and old minds through education. I work with Step8Up Academy and Jam Coding to better education for all.

**ðŸŒ± Currently learning:** NextJS, C# and electric guitar!

**ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:** Coding, teaching strategies, or anything related to science and programming!

**ðŸ“« How to reach me:** Feel free to connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zachlagden/).

**âš¡ Fun fact:** When I'm not coding or teaching, you can find me enjoying a round of golf or diving into my favorite music genres.

Let's collaborate and create something amazing! ðŸš€
