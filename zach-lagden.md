# Hi, I'm Zach! ðŸ‘‹

I'm not just a software developerâ€”I wear many hats. Based in Ascot, UK, Iâ€™m a dynamic entrepreneur, technical architect, and problem-solver. As the Co-Founder and Software Engineer at [CL Client Solutions](https://clclient.solutions) and Founder of [Lagden Development](https://lagden.dev), I thrive at the intersection of technology, business strategy, and creative thinking.

You can explore some of my open-source work through [Lagden Development](https://github.com/Lagden-Development). While many of my GitHub projects are private, Iâ€™m constantly building, iterating, and innovating.

**ðŸ”§ What I Bring to the Table:**
With a wealth of experience in business development, technical architecture, and software engineering, I manage everything from infrastructure to digital strategy. My skill set spans Ubuntu, VPS, Cloudflare, Flask, web development, NGINX, and beyond. Whether itâ€™s scaling a business, optimising servers, or developing web solutions, I love connecting the dots between technology and business growth.

**ðŸ”­ Current Focus:**  
Iâ€™m focused on growing my business by redefining what a marketing agency can be. We're expanding into web development, digital strategy, and data-driven marketing, with a unique niche: we make it incredibly easy for clients to work with us. Our process is seamless, personal, and focused on delivering high-quality results without hassle. My goal is to bridge the gap between technology and business while ensuring our clients experience simplicity and excellence.

**ðŸŒ± Always Learning & Growing:**  
Iâ€™m diving into NextJS, refining my skills on the electric guitar, and expanding my knowledge in server maintenance. But learning for me goes beyond codeâ€”Iâ€™m constantly pushing myself in business, leadership, and creative projects.

**ðŸ’¬ Ask Me About:**  
Programming, business strategy, entrepreneurship, server management, VPS, Cloudflare, web development, Flask, or music. Whether itâ€™s navigating the complexities of scaling a start-up or discussing the finer points of Python, Iâ€™m here for it.

**ðŸ“« Get in Touch:**  
Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zachlagden/) or send me an email at [zachlagden@lagden.dev](mailto:zachlagden@lagden.dev).

**âš¡ Fun Fact:**  
When Iâ€™m not coding or working on my business, youâ€™ll find me on the golf course, immersed in music, or exploring [another hobby/interest].

Iâ€™m passionate about creating impactful solutionsâ€”letâ€™s collaborate and bring your ideas to life! ðŸš€
