# Hi there, I'm Callum. ðŸ‘‹

An enthusiastic digital production, design, and development student based in the UK. In addition to my studies, I also serve as a code coach at [Jam Coding](https://jamcoding.co.uk/) where I help provide better coding education for the younger generation. I also volunteer at Bundle Group, contributing to events like Coaster Con which supports the Extra Life charity.
